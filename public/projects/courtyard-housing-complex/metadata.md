# Courtyard Housing Complex

## Project Overview

This housing complex reimagines multi-unit residential living by organizing 24 apartments around three interconnected courtyards. The design draws inspiration from traditional Indian courtyard houses while incorporating contemporary amenities and sustainable practices.

## Design Concept

The project addresses the growing need for affordable housing that doesn't compromise on quality of life. Each courtyard serves a different function - active play, contemplative garden, and community gathering - creating diverse spaces for residents of all ages.

## Key Features

- **Community-Centered Design**: Shared courtyards encourage neighborly interaction
- **Natural Ventilation**: Cross-ventilation through courtyards reduces energy consumption
- **Water Management**: Bioswales and permeable paving manage stormwater
- **Flexible Units**: 1, 2, and 3-bedroom apartments to accommodate diverse families
- **Rooftop Gardens**: Productive landscapes for residents to grow food

## Sustainable Features

- **Rainwater Harvesting**: 70% of irrigation needs met through collected rainwater
- **Solar Hot Water**: Individual solar heaters for each unit
- **Waste Management**: On-site composting and recycling facilities
- **Local Materials**: Locally sourced brick and stone reduce embodied energy

## Specifications

- **Total Units**: 24 apartments
- **Site Area**: 1.2 acres
- **Built-up Area**: 28,000 sq ft
- **Completion**: January 2024
- **Occupancy**: 85 residents

## Community Impact

The project has become a model for affordable housing in Gujarat, demonstrating that thoughtful design can create dignified living spaces within budget constraints while fostering community bonds.
