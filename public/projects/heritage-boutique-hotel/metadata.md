# Heritage Boutique Hotel

## Project Overview

The transformation of the 150-year-old Ratan Haveli into a 12-room boutique hotel represents our commitment to preserving architectural heritage while creating contemporary hospitality experiences. Located in Jaipur's historic walled city, the project required careful balance between conservation and modern comfort.

## Design Philosophy

Our approach was to honor the original craftsmanship while discreetly integrating modern amenities. Every intervention was reversible, ensuring the historical fabric remained intact. Traditional techniques were employed alongside contemporary conservation methods.

## Heritage Conservation

- **Structural Restoration**: Original load-bearing walls and arched openings preserved
- **Decorative Elements**: Hand-painted frescoes and mirror work carefully restored
- **Traditional Techniques**: Lime mortar and traditional plasters used throughout
- **Craft Revival**: Local artisans employed to restore intricate jali work and murals

## Modern Interventions

- **Climate Control**: Discrete HVAC systems integrated without altering facades
- **Lighting Design**: LED systems highlight architectural features
- **Accessibility**: Carefully designed ramps and lifts for universal access
- **Technology**: WiFi and modern bathrooms seamlessly integrated

## Sustainable Practices

- **Water Conservation**: Rainwater harvesting in restored traditional tanks
- **Energy Efficiency**: Solar panels concealed on rooftop areas
- **Waste Reduction**: Construction waste minimized through careful planning
- **Local Sourcing**: Materials and craftsmen sourced locally

## Specifications

- **Rooms**: 12 luxury suites
- **Built-up Area**: 15,000 sq ft
- **Courtyard**: 2,400 sq ft central courtyard
- **Completion**: August 2023
- **Heritage Grade**: ASI Grade II listed building

## Recognition

- **INTACH Award**: Excellence in Heritage Conservation 2023
- **Travel + Leisure**: Featured as "Best Heritage Hotel" 2024
- **Architectural Review**: International recognition for adaptive reuse

## Cultural Impact

The project has become a catalyst for heritage tourism in the area, inspiring other property owners to restore rather than demolish their historic buildings. It demonstrates the economic viability of heritage conservation.
